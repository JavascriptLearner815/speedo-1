# speedo-1
## Description
This is the first version of the Speedo operating system. This is completely unofficial, but also not a joke.
## Plan
The operating system has default, manually-coded programs. It uses Node.js to get information from websites and display it in its own "browser". Downloads are
installed to the host machine, then read inside of the operating system to run them.
